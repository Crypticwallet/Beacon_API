  summary: Get committee updates in an inclusive range of sync periods
  description: |
    Returns an array of best updates in the requested periods within the inclusive range `from` - `to`.
    Best is defined by (in order of priority):
    - Is finalized update + > 2/3 participations
    - Highest participation (bit count)
    - Oldest update
    Tracks oldest instead of newest to reduce disk writes and the likelyhood of re-orgs. Clients may choose
    a different set of "best" criteria if necessary.
