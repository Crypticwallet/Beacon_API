  summary: "Subscribe to state or block proofs of future blocks"
  description: |
    Ensures that a [MultiProofResponse](../../../types/api.yaml#/MultiProofResponse) will be available	for the states or blocks of
    all *requested* future blocks in the specified [MultiProofRequest](../../../types/api.yaml#/MultiProofRequest) format. A block is
    *requested* if `block.slot >= first+k*period > block.parent.slot` for any non-negative integer `k`. The default 	values of `first` and
    `period` are both 0. A [MultiProofResponse](../../../types/api.yaml#/MultiProofResponse) is immediately returned for the last existing
    canonical *requested* block if the state or block Merkle tree of that block is available. Otherwise a zero-length byte vector is
    returned which means that the subscription has been successfully activated for future *requested* blocks. The generated proofs are
    guaranteed to be available through `state` or `block` requests for 60 seconds. The subscription is guaranteed to stay active until its
    *inactive timer* reaches 60 seconds. This timer is started whenever a new proof for a *requested* block is generated and it is stopped
    and reset to zero whenever a [state](./state.yaml) or [block](./block.yaml) request is made to any response generated by the subscription.
