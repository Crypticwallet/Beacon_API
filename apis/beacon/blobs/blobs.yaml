  summary: Get blobs
  description: |
    Retrieves blobs for a given block id.
    Depending on `Accept` header it can be returned either as json or as bytes serialized by SSZ.
    It is recommended that blob retrieval for finalized blocks should by done by slot else the underlying index might not be available.
