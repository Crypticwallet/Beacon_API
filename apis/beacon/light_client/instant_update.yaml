  operationId: getLightClientInstantUpdate
  summary: Get a `LightClientInstantUpdate` for the given (recent) block header
  description: |
    Requests the best [`LightClientInstantUpdate`](../../../types/altair/light_client.yaml#/Altair/LightClientInstantUpdate) known by the server for the given block header.
    Depending on the `Accept` header it can be returned either as JSON or SSZ-serialized bytes.

    Servers providing this endpoint SHOULD always listen to the sync committee signature gossip and collect individual signatures. On request the best BLS
    signature is aggregated and returned for the specified (recent) block header. When a new block appears, the previously known best sync aggregate for its
    parent is compared against the sync aggregate found in the new block and replaced if the canonical one is better. Best sync aggregates are retained and
    served for the 16 most recent slots.
    Note that since always listening to the signature gossip costs some resources, it is acceptable to only start listening once this endpoint is called
    and stop listening if it is not called for an extended period of time.
